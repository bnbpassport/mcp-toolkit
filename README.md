# BNB Passport MCP Toolkit

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

The `@bnbpassport/mcp-toolkit` is a modular framework built around the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP standardizes AI agent interactions by providing a structured way to handle identity-related workflows. This toolkit enables AI agents to securely manage decentralized identities (DIDs), verifiable credentials, and trust registries, making it an essential component for AI-driven identity systems. This repository allows developers to configure and deploy an MCP server with the available toolkits.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- pnpm 8 or higher
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and MCP
